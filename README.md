/boot/config.txt




RetroArcade-machine is using Raspbian Linux distribution with RetroPie (https://retropie.org.uk/) installed on top of it 
(You can use these guides for installation: https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Debian/#download-retropie, https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-retropie-app-raspberry-pi/)

Raspbians Lightdm Desktop environment can be accessed by the 'Desktop'-button within the RetroPie menu (Can be found among the game consoles list).
For use in public, it is recommended to use the 'Kiosk'-mode found by pressing 'start' -> UI Settings -> UI Mode and changing it from 'Full' to 'Kiosk'.
'Kiosk'-mode disables most settings, so players can't mess the system up too badly. 

'Kiosk'-mode can be disabled by using the Konami-code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A). When input correctly, emulationstation loading screen
pops up brifly and both settings menus are available again.
